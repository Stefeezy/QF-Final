# QF-Final 
Quantitative Finance Project

This was my submission for a Quantitative Finance Final Project from my Fall 2021 semester. A Capstone course. 

The aim was to compare a portfolio's return vs the return of an ETF.
In this case it was the S&P500, but can easily be swapped to another ETF by changing to a valid link for the variable "csv"

The file is in .ipynb format, so opening with anything compatible is reccommended. 
This was written in Jupyter Lab, so I reccomend it. My professor convinced me of its usefulness for data oriented tasks. 
I've commented in each cell, highlighting the process going on. 

The code is definitely not perfect, but it runs. It and other submissions throughout the course secured me an A+, put I know I could have done better. 
It was one of my first times working with matplotlib and pandas.
